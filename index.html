                            Change is constant, and the world doesn't wait for anyone. Human history is filled with systems,
                            ideals, religions, peoples, or civilizations that once existed but eventually disappeared due to 
                            revolutions, economic crises, legitimacy challenges, or simple technological shifts. Or so we 
                            thought. A civilization can die, and its descendants may still hold onto its ideals when they 
                            have nothing else to cling to. Well, the ideals upon which we built our civilization are 
                            completely dead. However, we still hold onto them, partly embraced by what could have been, on 
                            the other hand, fearful because their fall becomes inevitable.

                            Take, for example, the pension system, where both workers and office employees were promised a 
                            retirement with health and a guaranteed pension to spend their final years in exchange for a 
                            life of loyalty and servitude to the company. It's no news that this ideal is a promise denied 
                            to future generations or even to current salaried workers.

                            boundaries are no longer the barriers they once were, a skilled professional in India can vie 
                            for the same job opportunity as someone in the United States or Europe, bridging the geographical 
                            gap that once limited employment prospects.

                            aspirations for the future have become nothing more than a myth to achieve because we grew up 
                            and were prepared for a world that simply no longer exists.

                            In this essay, we will talk about the middle class, a social class born from the Industrial 
                            Revolution due to the need for better-skilled wage earners in the workforce. Characterized 
                            by higher incomes, better education, and brighter prospects for the future, they now face 
                            crises that expose their fragile existence in the face of a new global paradigm of constant 
                            technological and productive change, where this social class has been eroding for decades, 
                            and its decline becomes evident.

                            In this essay, we will pose the following question: Are you part of the middle class? 
                            It may seem straightforward, but the more you think about it, the more confusing it can 
                            become. What criteria do you consider when answering this question? Is it your earnings, 
                            educational background, financial stability, or way of living? Many people nowadays 
                            identify themselves as part of this social class because there is no definitive consensus 
                            on how to define who belongs to it.
                            <br>
                            However, What is supposed to be the middle class?
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            The middle class, by default, is neither poor nor rich. They do not have enough capital to live 
                            solely off the interest that it produces for them, so must actively manage their finances and engage 
                            in business ventures. Specialized and technician professionals also enter this group, although they 
                            do not have their own capital, thanks to their skills allow them to fulfill all of their basic 
                            necessities, acquire certain benefits, and secure their future with these needs met.
                            <br>
                            We will use this definition to exemplify the difference between the working class and the upper class, 
                            although this concept may be too broad to the point that it can be impossible to recognize who should 
                            belong to it.
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            So, we will start with one of the most widely recognized methods of categorizing individuals: 
                            dividing them by their earnings. Depending on the criteria used, people can be divided into 
                            three or five different social classes, or perhaps even more, as this method is somewhat arbitrary.
                            <br>
                            Can we really determine someone's social class based solely on their income?

                            According to a survey in 2017 conducted by the Gallup Group, Americans were asked to classify 
                            themselves into five social classes: upper, upper-middle, middle, working, and lower. The results 
                            of the analysis showed that 3% of respondents identified themselves as belonging to the upper class, 
                            15% as upper-middle class, 43% as middle class, 30% as working class, and 8% as lower class.

                        <p>
                            Why do people with a clear earnings difference say they are in the same social class? To better 
                            comprehend the challenge of categorizing based on earnings, let us examine a few examples.
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            Consider the scenario where an individual who has completed their doctoral degree at a university must 
                            dedicate a sizable portion of their initial income for several years to repay their student loans, this 
                            will restrict their ability to accumulate wealth.
                            <br>
                            On the other hand, a family from a lower social class may have a child who is able to attain a high-paying 
                            job with hard work and good fortune, which could potentially improve their social status. In such a scenario, 
                            the family must prioritize saving every possible penny to accumulate wealth and break free from the 'Cycle of Poverty.'
                            <br>
                            These instances underscore the complexity of defining social class based solely on income, not forgetting there 
                            are other factors to consider. These may include debts, place of residence, consumer habits, whether or not a family 
                            member has a chronic health problem, or even the economic inheritance of the person, as seen in the second example.
                            <br><br>
                            So is not a surprise that both people earning $20k and people earning almost $250k called themselves middle class
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            Thare other factors that set the middle class apart from the lower class: their properties, stable employment, studies, 
                            and prospects for further progress. Even though these may vary, they are the fundamental requirements that differentiate them. 
                            <br>
                            What is the most vital property for a family? Undoubtedly, it's their home.

                            the number of homeowners, and despite some recovery, it is still far

                            Countless households are grappling with the surge in living expenses and inflation,

                            The second-largest form of debt is student loans. This debt is the fastest growing as a 
                            percentage, having shot up 568% from 2003 to 2023. This means that as a relative share 
                            of total household debt, student loans increased by more than five times their original 
                            starting balance.

                            The indiscriminate surge in household debt to meet the minimum standards of the middle class and those who 
                            aspire to join it reflects the impact of unstable financial and employment conditions on the prospects of progress.

                            The stagnation of wages accompanied by high inflation, has declined the stable economy that had been characterized 
                            by this class, resulting in a society burdened with debt. The question arises, How many of those who consider themselves 
                            middle class will be able to avoid falling into poverty without resorting to debt?

                            The current financial and employment conditions, cyclical crises, the rise of the gig economy, and wealth inequality 
                            raise questions about the future of the middle class for the following generations.

                            But how did we come to this point? What events have led us here, and what lies ahead in this uncertain future? We need 
                            to look back at history to understand how we have reached this point.
