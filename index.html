                            Change is constant, and the world doesn't wait for anyone. Human history is filled with systems,
                            ideals, religions, peoples, or civilizations that once existed but eventually disappeared due to 
                            revolutions, economic crises, legitimacy challenges, or simple technological shifts. Or so we 
                            thought. A civilization can die, and its descendants may still hold onto its ideals when they 
                            have nothing else to cling to. Well, the ideals upon which we built our civilization are 
                            completely dead. However, we still hold onto them, partly embraced by what could have been, on 
                            the other hand, fearful because their fall becomes inevitable.

                            Take, for example, the pension system, where both workers and office employees were promised a 
                            retirement with health and a guaranteed pension to spend their final years in exchange for a 
                            life of loyalty and servitude to the company. It's no news that this ideal is a promise denied 
                            to future generations or even to current salaried workers.

                            In the era of globalization has redefined how individuals pursue job opportunities. Geographical 
                            boundaries are no longer the barriers they once were, a skilled professional in India can vie 
                            for the same job opportunity as someone in the United States or Europe, bridging the geographical 
                            gap that once limited employment prospects.

                            We are surrounded by technologies and contexts that we are just beginning to understand. Our 
                            reality is defined by things that didn't exist 30 years ago. Similarly, our expectations and 
                            aspirations for the future have become nothing more than a myth to achieve because we grew up 
                            and were prepared for a world that simply no longer exists.

                            In this essay, we will talk about the middle class, a social class born from the Industrial 
                            Revolution due to the need for better-skilled wage earners in the workforce. Characterized 
                            by higher incomes, better education, and brighter prospects for the future, they now face 
                            crises that expose their fragile existence in the face of a new global paradigm of constant 
                            technological and productive change, where this social class has been eroding for decades, 
                            and its decline becomes evident.
