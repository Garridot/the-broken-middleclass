                            Change is constant, and the world doesn't wait for anyone. Human history is filled with systems,
                            ideals, religions, peoples, or civilizations that once existed but eventually disappeared due to 
                            revolutions, economic crises, legitimacy challenges, or simple technological shifts. Or so we 
                            thought. A civilization can die, and its descendants may still hold onto its ideals when they 
                            have nothing else to cling to. Well, the ideals upon which we built our civilization are 
                            completely dead. However, we still hold onto them, partly embraced by what could have been, on 
                            the other hand, fearful because their fall becomes inevitable.

                            Take, for example, the pension system, where both workers and office employees were promised a 
                            retirement with health and a guaranteed pension to spend their final years in exchange for a 
                            life of loyalty and servitude to the company. It's no news that this ideal is a promise denied 
                            to future generations or even to current salaried workers.

                            boundaries are no longer the barriers they once were, a skilled professional in India can vie 
                            for the same job opportunity as someone in the United States or Europe, bridging the geographical 
                            gap that once limited employment prospects.

                            aspirations for the future have become nothing more than a myth to achieve because we grew up 
                            and were prepared for a world that simply no longer exists.

                            In this essay, we will talk about the middle class, a social class born from the Industrial 
                            Revolution due to the need for better-skilled wage earners in the workforce. Characterized 
                            by higher incomes, better education, and brighter prospects for the future, they now face 
                            crises that expose their fragile existence in the face of a new global paradigm of constant 
                            technological and productive change, where this social class has been eroding for decades, 
                            and its decline becomes evident.

                            In this essay, we will pose the following question: Are you part of the middle class? 
                            It may seem straightforward, but the more you think about it, the more confusing it can 
                            become. What criteria do you consider when answering this question? Is it your earnings, 
                            educational background, financial stability, or way of living? Many people nowadays 
                            identify themselves as part of this social class because there is no definitive consensus 
                            on how to define who belongs to it.
                            <br>
                            However, What is supposed to be the middle class?
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            The middle class, by default, is neither poor nor rich. They do not have enough capital to live 
                            solely off the interest that it produces for them, so must actively manage their finances and engage 
                            in business ventures. Specialized and technician professionals also enter this group, although they 
                            do not have their own capital, thanks to their skills allow them to fulfill all of their basic 
                            necessities, acquire certain benefits, and secure their future with these needs met.
                            <br>
                            We will use this definition to exemplify the difference between the working class and the upper class, 
                            although this concept may be too broad to the point that it can be impossible to recognize who should 
                            belong to it.
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            So, we will start with one of the most widely recognized methods of categorizing individuals: 
                            dividing them by their earnings. Depending on the criteria used, people can be divided into 
                            three or five different social classes, or perhaps even more, as this method is somewhat arbitrary.
                            <br>
                            Can we really determine someone's social class based solely on their income?

                            According to a survey in 2017 conducted by the Gallup Group, Americans were asked to classify 
                            themselves into five social classes: upper, upper-middle, middle, working, and lower. The results 
                            of the analysis showed that 3% of respondents identified themselves as belonging to the upper class, 
                            15% as upper-middle class, 43% as middle class, 30% as working class, and 8% as lower class.

                            Why do people with a clear earnings difference say they are in the same social class? To better 
                            comprehend the challenge of categorizing based on earnings, let us examine a few examples.
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            Consider the scenario where an individual who has completed their doctoral degree at a university must 
                            dedicate a sizable portion of their initial income for several years to repay their student loans, this 
                            will restrict their ability to accumulate wealth.
                            <br>
                            On the other hand, a family from a lower social class may have a child who is able to attain a high-paying 
                            job with hard work and good fortune, which could potentially improve their social status. In such a scenario, 
                            the family must prioritize saving every possible penny to accumulate wealth and break free from the 'Cycle of Poverty.'
                            <br>
                            These instances underscore the complexity of defining social class based solely on income, not forgetting there 
                            are other factors to consider. These may include debts, place of residence, consumer habits, whether or not a family 
                            member has a chronic health problem, or even the economic inheritance of the person, as seen in the second example.
                            <br><br>
                            So is not a surprise that both people earning $20k and people earning almost $250k called themselves middle class
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            Thare other factors that set the middle class apart from the lower class: their properties, stable employment, studies, 
                            and prospects for further progress. Even though these may vary, they are the fundamental requirements that differentiate them. 
                            <br>
                            What is the most vital property for a family? Undoubtedly, it's their home.

                            From its peak in the early 2000s, there was a significant decrease in 
                            the number of homeowners, and despite some recovery, it is still far 
                            below the high before the 2008 financial crisis.

                            It is concerning to note that as of 2023, the collective household debt in the United 
                            States has skyrocketed to a staggering $17.06 trillion, amounting to an average of $118,000 
                            in debt per household. Notably, mortgage debt accounts for a significant 70% of the total 
                            household debt, having risen by $5.1 trillion since 2003 and currently standing at $12.04 
                            trillion.

                            The second-largest form of debt is student loans. This debt is the fastest growing as a 
                            percentage, having shot up 568% from 2003 to 2023. This means that as a relative share 
                            of total household debt, student loans increased by more than five times their original 
                            starting balance.

                            The indiscriminate surge in household debt to meet the minimum standards of the middle class and those who 
                            aspire to join it reflects the impact of unstable financial and employment conditions on the prospects of progress.

                            The stagnation of wages accompanied by high inflation, has declined the stable economy that had been characterized 
                            by this class, resulting in a society burdened with debt. The question arises, How many of those who consider themselves 
                            middle class will be able to avoid falling into poverty without resorting to debt?

                            As the division of labor became more pronounced and industries adopted specialization, 
                            there was a need for individuals with expertise in various domains. These educated professionals 
                            played a crucial role in managing, coordinating, and administering flourishing industries. This era 
                            witnessed the birth of what we now recognize as the modern middle class, whose foundations rested on 
                            education as the primary catalyst for job security, higher wages, and better prospects for social mobility.

                            In the post-World War II era, the United States emerged as a global economic powerhouse. The country experienced 
                            unprecedented economic growth, and technological innovations, such as the widespread availability of automobiles, 
                            televisions, and household appliances, revolutionized daily life. The 'American Dream' encapsulated the idea that 
                            through hard work, anyone could achieve upward mobility and a higher standard of living.
                            <br><br>
                            It was truly a moment where the middle and working class could glimpse the possibilities of social mobility and 
                            prosperity. This era laid the foundation for what commonly springs to mind when envisioning the Middle Class—owning 
                            a home in the suburbs, driving a car, and providing a better future for one's children become the aspirations of the middle class.

                            Thanks to industrial advances, plastics and synthetic materials began to dominate everything. Similarly, they began to transform the 
                            socio-cultural customs of society, giving rise to the consumer society, where owning and consuming goods became symbols of success and social status.
                            <br><br>
                            The emergence of household appliances capable of performing domestic chores liberated women from what was then their fate, leading to 
                            homemakers having time to dedicate themselves to both work and the pursuit of personal fulfillment. Despite the traditions of the time 
                            attempting to maintain the status quo, the change in paradigm was inevitable.
                            <br><br>
                            With the democratization of consumption, people from diverse economic backgrounds now seek to bridge the social gap through the acquisition 
                            of consumer goods, often leading a life of debt or purchasing lower-quality goods.
                            <br><br>
                            Class barriers are breaking down, particularly for the middle and lower classes. This doesn't mean that social classes are disappearing. 
                            Quite the contrary, the gap between the upper class and the wage-earning class has only increased since the 70s-80s, with the advent of 
                            globalization, economic stagnation, and the end of the post-war economic boom.

                            cost savings and leverage lower labor costs. This paradigm shift in manufacturing and labor

                            altering the employment landscape and changing the dynamics of income distribution, leading 
                            to the erosion of traditional job security that translated into wage stagnation.

                            Although the earnings of the wage-earning class have been stagnant since the 70s, job precariousness and the erosion of job security have become the norm. 
                            Consumption hasn't stopped; in fact, it has only increased.
                            <br><br>
                            Image and consumerism have come to dictate the perceived success achievable by individuals and families within our society. The failure of systems that 
                            used to serve as society's moral compass has given way to a narrative centered around consumption and personal gratification. Within this context, material 
                            wealth and image consciousness are frequently equated with achievement and self-worth. This dynamic creates a self-perpetuating cycle that reinforces consumerism 
                            and reshapes the relationship between individuals and their desires.
                            <br><br>                            
                            These shifts in societal values have profound repercussions for the middle class. The pressures to conform to these consumer-centric norms propel individuals and 
                            families toward financial instability as they endeavor to maintain appearances, accumulate debt, and pursue lifestyles aligned with manufactured images of success. 
                            This quest for social status and identity through consumption further blurs the lines that once delineated social classes.
                            <br><br>                            
                            This phenomenon gives rise to what can be termed an 'impostor' social class: individuals who do not perceive themselves as impoverished due to their ability to 
                            accrue debt to consume. They try to distinguish themselves from those they regard as poor because of their incapacity to access credit to consume. However, the 
                            problem lies in the increasingly blurred line between this status and that of the middle class, where their salaries are getting closer, and not precisely because 
                            their purchasing power has increased.
                            <br><br>                            
                            But excessive consumption doesn't fully explain the decline of the middle class. As mentioned earlier, a large part of the accumulated household debt is destined 
                            to acquire the basic goods necessary to consider themselves middle class. So, why are there no strikes and protests to regain the labor conditions that allowed 
                            social mobility in the past, and the criticisms of the system have only been to soften its collateral damage since globalization?

                            Just one thing we can be certain of is technological progress. Fear and fascination intertwine as each 
                            technological barrier or ceiling is shattered. The most recurring fear is that of being replaced by 
                            a machine or some algorithm, primarily in one of the key aspects of modern life: work.

                            This process is called instrumentalization; it does not speak of humans but of objects. We don't care if the 
                            object is damaged because we care about the object itself, but rather that the object ceases to be useful. An 
                            individual's value as a human being depends solely on their ability to produce.
                            <br><br>
                            This can be exemplified by the working classes, who, despite technological and productive advances in factories, 
                            were denied their struggles for better working and wage conditions. As it turns out, their struggles were only 
                            conceived to persuade and avoid revolts due to the materialization of alternatives.
                            <br><br>
                            The middle class, which is currently facing the aforementioned crises, was born for purely utilitarian purposes; 
                            skilled workers were needed for new roles within companies. Improvements in health, salaries, and working 
                            conditions were due to the need for these workers to have the time and money to consume and ensure certain 
                            standards of living, where it was not necessary for their children to enter the workforce at an early age, giving 
                            them enough time to educate themselves to fill those roles in the companies, without worrying about the household 
                            economy.
                            <br><br>
                            In the same way, what is learned within basic educational institutions will only serve to the extent that it can 
                            generate future benefits, so any other knowledge, regardless of its potential usefulness to the student, does not 
                            matter.

                        Beyond any clichéd criticism, this mechanized mode of learning has been effective in providing highly skilled labor to society and, at the same time, serving as a social and economic ladder. However, the advancement of technologies capable of far surpassing human performance in learning this way, coupled with the inability to guarantee social ascent as it once did due to economic changes and other factors, cast doubt on this model of learning for the future.

                            This fear is not necessarily based on the automation of work per se, but rather on the utilitarian ethics inherited from 
                            industrialization in pursuit of improving performance and efficiency in resource utilization, whether human or raw materials.
                            Many processes can be done better and with better profit margins using machines; similarly, this trend seeks to be applied 
                            to humans, aiming to extract more than 100% productivity from a human, even if the human is incapable of surpassing "certain" limits.
                            <br><br>
                            The fear of the machine finds its reason for existence in this economic paradigm that emerged with globalization, with practices 
                            such as offshoring and subcontracting. An employee costs not only their salary but also their health insurance, pension, severance 
                            pay, regulation of working hours in the country, and their productivity can vary depending on the physical or psychological conditions 
                            of the person. It is not unreasonable for companies to decide to offshore and subcontract labor from countries with impoverished 
                            economies where labor rights are virtually non-existent in order to improve their profit margins.
                            <br><br>
                            Therefore, automation would be nothing more than taking current economic policies to another level. Because, in the end, both the 
                            manager of a renowned Western company and the child from Bangladesh forced to work in a textile plant are humans and, consequently, 
                            inferior when it comes to competing against the performance and efficiency that a machine with thousands of data and processors 
                            working at its disposal can offer.
                            <br><br>
                            The loss of jobs occurs with or without automation, as this phenomenon is due to political and economic factors rather than 
                            technological ones. When a large portion of jobs becomes scarce, what will happen to all the unemployed? Would the welfare state return, 
                            distributing the benefits of the highly automated world? Everything indicates that this would not be the case. As we saw earlier, 
                            inequalities are growing despite increased economic development. The job market has become incompatible with workers' protection. 
                            Globalization compels companies to compete ruthlessly, with local companies pitted against multinational corporations. 
                            The 2008 crisis showed that governments and private entities cared less about citizens experiencing severe economic problems, 
                            using the excuse of an "economic apocalypse" to bail out banks with public funding and leaving thousands of families unemployed 
                            and homeless. Some suggest a universal basic income in the face of incompetence in competing as producers and workers against automation. 
                            Humanity might be reduced to mere consumers. But for now, nothing is set in stone.
                            <br><br>
                            Countless possibilities await us at one of the most critical turning points in the future of humanity. The technologies being developed will have 
                            consequences in a world as complex as it is primarily human. For now, a better future or a dystopia awaits us, expectant, as the new industrial revolution unfolds.
